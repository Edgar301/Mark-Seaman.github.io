# Test Your Page

Your page is not published until you have confirmed that it is visible to the world.
Intending to publish is not the same and getting your page published.

Most students that fail to publish their work do not understand how the URLs work.
To address this issue follow the URL links that are on your student dashboard page.
These links point to the required pages for each graded assignment.

Your page is not published until these links lead to your page.
Once you get to your page make sure that you Validate it using the HTML validator.

Paste the link from the student dashboard page into Canvas.  This link must have "http://" in 
it to be a valid URL. Never submit a link with "file://" in it, since this 
is submitting a reference to a local file, rather than a URL to your Bluehost domain.

Make sure you submit the link that is found in your dashboard page into Canvas.  Canvas will refuse
any link that contains "file://".
