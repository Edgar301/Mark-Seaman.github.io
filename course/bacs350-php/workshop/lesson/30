## Resources

### Update Records
To update existing records in the database you must solve several problems

1. Select the record that you want to edit
2. Get the record value from a DB query
3. Show the edit form with the current values
4. Respond to the POST operation
5. Save the updated record


### templates/crud_read.php
* Shows how to display the data in a table
* Creates links to edit and delete
* Acts as the return page after editing


### templates/crud_update.php
* Presents the form
* Fills the form with current values
* Acts as the target page for the POST
* Saves the data
* Redirect back to crud_read.php


### templates/crud_delete.php
* Deletes the requested record
* Redirect back to crud_read.php


### templates/email_list.php
* Single page app that does all data operations


### templates/subscriber.php
* Object-oriented data handler
* Full CRUD setup
* Implements full application


### templates/subscriber-add-only.php
