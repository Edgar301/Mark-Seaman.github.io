# Time to Rebuild

I Will Rebuild My Life

* Life as I know it has ended
* What life will I rebuild?
* What life do I want to live?
* What actions will I take to create it?


Survive then Thrive

* Escaping the Grief Vortex
    * I have been overwhelmed with a sense of grief and loss
    * My emotional state has been elevated to DEFCON 2 since March 13
    * This is not how I will live moving forward
    * I must act now while I still can
    * Survival is not good enough!
* Physical safety is important
    * Carefully manage who is in my viral sphere
        * Hand washing
        * Mask when around people
        * No public gatherings
        * Minimize physical contact
    * Grief can cause serious physical damage
        * Key dangers - Bad sleep, too much alcohol, adrenaline addiction, anger at stupidity
        * Four faces of pain - Anger, Fear, Sadness, Shame
        * Fear can cause people to make bad decisions that increase danger
* Mental health is also important
    * Pay attention to Maslow - Health, Safety, Love, Identity, Purpose
    * Self awareness is essential for health
    * Relationships are the most cause of sustainable happiness
    * Social distancing (for safety) may result in emotional distances (isolation)
    * Emotional regulation is required for basic health
* I will find ways to thrive
    * Survival is not enough
    * I will probably live another 20 years
    * I must have a life worth living
    * Helping others is important for my health
    * I will use my unique gifts to serve others
* My life will be rich
    * Meaningful work - creative contribution to others
    * Meaningful relationships - more time with people I love and avoid others
    * Personal growth - thriving in the midst of chaos
    * Fun - live every day as if it matters (laugh, play, dream big)
