# Teams for Final Project

### Design Teams

Each student is assigned to a team to complete all of the design reviews.  
You will each be accountable for your own work.  

Teams were created based on your preferences and are set up to produce
the best results for the project.


### Reviews

You will also be responsible
to give timely, accurate, and helpful feedback to the other designers in your 
group.

Each week there will be a round of reviews which have a different set of requirements.
You are required to complete each of the four reviews for your teammates.

Each week I will schedule all of the reviews.  On Friday, check your review queue and
complete the reviews as quickly as possible.  Be timely, accurate, and helpful.

I will publish explicit requirements for each project Milestone.  Complete one round
of reviews for each milestone.
