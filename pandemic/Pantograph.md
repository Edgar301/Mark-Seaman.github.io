I have recently joined a project with a multinational team of scientists and software developers.  Our goal is to understand the variations of the COVID-19 virus that are already in the population.  This is critical for the long term effectiveness of the vaccines that will be built to fight it.

You can learn about the project at https://graph-genome.github.io.  I will be setting up the software development process to support the expanded development team and doing some project management.  


**Short term**

We are hosting a Software Hackathon on April 5-11 to develop the software tools that will be used in this effort.  We are hoping to begin producing scientific insights within the next few weeks.

We are actively recruiting software developers for the Hackathon that are strong developers with C++, Python, or React.  Read about the project and see if you want to get involved.


**Long term**

This project has a comprehensive plan to understand the COVID-19 virus and all of its mutations.  This project will be an ongoing research effort that will take at least a year.  We will also need to secure funding in order to expand the team.  We need individuals with business expertise that could help us make a larger impact.

We will be recruiting people with project management, business management, and grant writing skills.  We already have a team of scientists involved in the project from Germany, Japan, UK, and Italy.  This is clearly a global problem and the solutions will all be global.

If you are interested in learning more then contact me directly and Iâ€™ll set up a call.
