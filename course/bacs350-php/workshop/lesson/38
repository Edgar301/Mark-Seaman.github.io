## Software Testing

### Key Question
How do we know if the software is good?


### Codify the requirements
* Outline the milestones (4 milestones)
* Features in each milestone (3-5 features for each milestone)
* Write down the test cases (convert the feature list)
* Use as a testing checklist
* Functional and non-functional requirements


### Incremental Development
* Build testing into every milestone
* Let feedback steer your effort
* Do not build anything you do not need
* Automate your test cases


### What you build today should get value tomorrow
