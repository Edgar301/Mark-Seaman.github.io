# Final Project Design Requirements


## Class Requirements

The final project in BACS 200/495 will take the last four weeks of class.  In addition to 
completing the final project you will read the assigned sections of the Zybooks text. These
will be the only remaining grades for the class.

The final project will be completed in Milestones.  During each Milestone you will produce
a unique set of requirements that will culminate with an awesome website.

Reviews will be conducted at each Milestone to make sure that the project is on track.  Progress
should be made each week to make sure that you complete on time.


## Grading

There will only be two grades for the final project. 

* 30 Points for Design
* 30 Points for Review

### Design Grade (30 Points)

The intermediate reviews will NOT count toward your design grade for the final project.

The final designer grade will be based on how many of the requirements that you
meet in Milestone 4.


### Review Grade (30 Points)

* 20 Points for completing all reviews (you must complete all or get 0 Points)
* 10 Points for feedback from the team members about your value to the team
