* Cookies & Sessions



## Cookies

How do you use the browser to remember somethings between pages?

* Cookies can be set by the server
* The server can read cookies from the browser


### Set a Cookie
Create a variable stored in the Browser

```
setcookie ('FIRST_TIME', 'FALSE');
```


### Read a Cookie
Execute Differently Based on the Cookie

```
if ($_COOKIE['FIRST_TIME'] == "TRUE") {
    act_on_first_time();
}
```


### Initialize the Cookie
Uninitialized cookies can cause errors

```
if (! isset($_COOKIE['FIRST_TIME'])) {
    $_COOKIE['FIRST_TIME'] = "TRUE";
} 
```


### Cookies Are Remembered Forever
You can also add an expiration date

* Closing the browser does not reset the cookie


### Sessions are Reset When Browser Closes
Special kind of cookies

* Closing the browser resets the session cookies

```
session_start ();
$_SESSION['SHOPPING'] = 'TRUE';
```


### Check the Session Cookie
Handle the uninitialized case

```
if (isset($_SESSION['SHOPPING']) and $_SESSION['SHOPPING']=='TRUE')
```
