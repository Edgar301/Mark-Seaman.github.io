# Invitation to Meet

Life as we know it has ended!   Now we are all faced with the challenge of building a new one. This is a profound challenge that will require all of the energy that have. 

Many of us have lost so much and are in a deep state of grief.  In order to build a new life, I need others to help me restore my faith, hope, and love.  I need the perspective that others have and desire to share mine in return.

The journey to rebuild is best done with others that we trust.  Iâ€™m looking to find like minded people that want to move forward in life together.  Now that our traditional methods have been removed new possibilities for interacting are feasible.  Physical location is no longer a barrier to relationships.

This lets us spend more time with people we actually want to be with.  I am eager to renew relationships that have been neglected for far too long.  Now that the social distancing has freed up many standing obligations I desire to replace that time investment into social connections with true friends.

I believe that by sharing our best insights and creativity we can build something extraordinary together!
