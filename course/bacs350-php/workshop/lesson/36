## Markdown

### Why not HTML?
* HTML is too wordy
* Syntax is too complex
* Lots of redundant typing


### Markup/Markdown
* HTML is a markup language
* Markers are added to plain text for formatting
* This causes inflation of 100% to 600% in source code


### Markdown
* A markdown language converts plain text into HTML
* Simple formatting is applied
* Easy and quick to write

Markdown

    # Heading
    
HTML

    <h1>Heading</h1>
