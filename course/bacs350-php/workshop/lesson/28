### Real-world Projects
* Every project has unspoken requirements
* Two solutions to finding requirements
    * Be a mind-reader
    * Work incrementally
* Choose the latter


### Traditional Lifecycle
* Requirements
* Design
* Coding
* Test


### Impossible to know the Requirements
* Understanding of requirements comes from experience
* Need to gain experience before setting the requirements
* Need to use customer feedback


### Incremental Development
* Get an idea and build a prototype
* Show it off to the customer to get feedback
* Fix what needs to be fixed
* Confirm that you understood


### Huge Productivity Difference
* Cost of small app project
    - 1000 hours = $100,000 (Traditional)
    -  500 hours =  $50,000 (Agile)
