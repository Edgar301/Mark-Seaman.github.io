### Courses Under Development

At Shrinking World Solutions, we believe that learning about technology should
lead to  skills that can be immediately applied to real-world projects.
Therefore the techniques that are used in the learning process must be  updated
to match the needs of modern students.

[Our Vision](/shrinkingworld/Vision) is to produce high impact training that will give you the
maximum capability for the hours invested.
There are several aspects that define our approach to learning and are a radical
departure from other training that is available.

* Hands-on
* Projects
* Running Examples
* Reading before Writing
* Design Reviews
* Requirements
* Software Tools
* Design Patterns
