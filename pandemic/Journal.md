These are crazy times. We are experiencing the greatest global turmoil since World War II.

Never before has the world been so tightly coupled. The events that are at play today will 
permanently impact all of the people across the globe. Social structures that have been in 
place for decades will need to be reinvented to cope with the fallout of the pandemic.

The Black Death Plague swept through Europe for five years (1347-1352). It decimated the 
population, killing between 1/3 and 1/2 of the people in Europe. This marked a major turning
point in European history, and fundamentally altered society.

Although the Coronavirus is not nearly as deadly the impact will be just as significant.
All of our lives will be defined by the time we recall before the virus struck.  There will
be no going back only forward.  We will survive and the world will be reinvented during
this time of crisis.

This journal is to track the significant events and experiences in my life and the life of
my family, city, state, country, and world.  I intend to write about what is happening and
what should happen to make sense of this tragedy that has come upon us all.

I want to mind us of the words of the Greek story teller Aesop, who lived during the 
6th Century B.C., "United we Stand, Divided we Fall".  We are definitely in this together.
