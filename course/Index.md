# Practical Software Engineering Courses

## Teaching Philosophy

At Shrinking World Solutions, we believe that learning about technology should
lead to  skills that can be immediately applied to real-world projects.
Therefore teaching techniques must be constantly updated
to meet the needs of modern students.

Our vision is to produce high-impact training that will give you the
maximum capability for the hours invested.
There are several aspects that define our approach to learning and are a radical
departure from other training that is available.

* Hands-on
* Projects
* Running Examples
* Reading before Writing
* Design Reviews
* Requirements
* Software Tools
* Design Patterns
