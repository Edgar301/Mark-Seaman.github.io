### Overview

### Grading
* Skill drills
* Integrated apps
* Quizzes
* Exams
* Exams are for testing knowledge
* Projects are for testing capability


### Review
* Use includes to capture page layout
* Create and use databases
* Build an app by creating building blocks
* Now we must learn to create better structures
* Modern code sharing practices


### Next Steps
* Development productivity
* Technical details of PHP and MySQL
* App structure and design



## App Design

### Every app has a design
* Design should change to reflect understanding
* Designs should be reused as patterns


### Refactoring
* Popularized by Martin Fowler
* Code gets worse with time
* Make code better by improving its structure


### How to Refactor
* Bad smells indicate the need for cleanup
* Must be done with good tests
* Change the structure without changing the features
* Refactor every time you touch the code
* Only refactor a working system that can be easily tested


### Process for Refactoring
* Find a bad smell
* Clean it up
* Make sure nothing broke



## CRUD Functions

### Limits of File Includes
* Everything weve done is based on files
* Functions will make our code cleaner
* PHP code should be gathered together in files
* All database code should be consolidated
* Too many small pieces


### Learn programming by programming
* All code is demonstrated in [Solution 14](http://unco-bacs.org/bacs_350/solution/14)


### Steps to MVC
* Step 1 - Page Structure
* Step 2 - Database Connection
* Step 3 - CRUD
* Step 4 - Views
* Step 5 - Controller
* Step 5 - Testing


### MVC Design Pattern
* CRUD operations are consolidated in functions
* Views are encapsulated by functions
* Controller processes action verbs


### Project #17 - due Friday
* Refactor your application into an MVC Design pattern
* Build out full CRUD



## eBook

### Interactive Learning Tool
* Better tools can accelerate learning
* Static reading does not fully engage the brain
* Need to invoke problem solving


### New Tool for Interactive Learning
* Read text/answer questions/do exercises
* Aim to fill holes in understanding
