# Whose in your Viralsphere?

This is a question that I never used to ponder.  But that was in a different age.
Epidemics were a thing of books and movies, the simple figments of a dark imagination.

This is a very interesting question at this moment in time.  Now our lives and those 
we love depend on who we invite into our viralsphere.

We all interact with many people each day.  Every point of contact with a person is an
opportunity to exchange pathogens.  Whether it is bacteria or virus we are constantly
trading with others.

Normally this is no big deal because the impact of catching the latest version of the
cold is quite normal and expected.  On the other hand, killer pathogens like Ebola, SARS,
Small Pox, and now COVID-19 are a very big deal.

Each of these killers carries with it a known mortality and infection rate. Epidemiologist
can solve the math based on a few coefficients to determine both the infection rate and
death toll in a particular outbreak.

I have spent a great deal of time pondering this morbid math but choose not to share it
here.  There is very little to be done beyond taking personal precautions. There is no
value making you lie awake at night contemplating what might happen.

So, that brings us back to the Viralsphere.  According to today's numbers 1 out of 1000 
Americans have been hospitalized.  The Johns-Hopkins site posts the number of confirmed 
infections.  With virtually no testing these are a count of hospital cases with the
virus.

The actual infection rate is probably ten times higher than that. This means that 1 out
of every 100 people you interact with is infected.  Getting infected is a numbers game.
If you only interact with a few people then you are relatively safe. But if you have
interactions with many people each day then you are at significant risk.

We have eight people in our Viralsphere.  Since March 13 we have been as isolated as
we can possibly be.  We send people out to get food and supplies but other than that
have no physical contact with others.

When one of us go out to a store we take extreme precautions to help ensure that we
are not bringing any unplanned pain into our world.  This could be a practice that 
many of us will be using until a solid vaccine can be developed.
