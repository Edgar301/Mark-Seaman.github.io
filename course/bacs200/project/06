    * Select the image that shows in the initial view.
* Audience. 
    * "Not made for kids", and "Restrict to over 18" will stop ads from playing.

    * "Unlisted" lets you use the video in a page without having it be part of your YouTube channel. 
    * "Public" makes it visible in your channel.

### More YouTube Options
* Comments. "Disable comments" or "Hold all comments for review" to prevent spam.
