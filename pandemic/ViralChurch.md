# Church gone Viral

What ... Too Soon?

When the pandemic hits, life does not stop it just morphs into something else.

We have moved all our meeting online. 

## Sunday Service

Our Sunday Services are recorded and broadcast as a Facebook Live event.  This allows everyone to
meet virtually and exchange comments with one another.
